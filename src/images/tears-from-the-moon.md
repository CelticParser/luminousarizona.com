> _The silver disc hangs heavy in the night,
<br>
A pearly orb, majestic and serene,
<br>
But from its eye, a single, dropping light
<br><br>
Descends, a tear, a sorrowful, bright sheen,
<br>Or so it seems, a droplet from the moon,
<br>A falling star, a wish upon the breeze?
<br><br>
But closer look reveals a different tune,
<br>A metal bird that cuts through cosmic seas
<br><br>
No tear this is, but rather cold disdain,
<br>A scar across the face of lunar grace
<br><br>
The Man in the Moon, he feels a sharp, deep pain,
<br>As human progress mars his sacred space
<br><br>
His silent tears for nature's fading gleam,
<br>Reflected in this cold, mechanic stream._
