<b><i>"The objects and structures we leave behind possess a unique narrative, acquiring a spectral dignity as time and the elements claim them."</i></b>

From the skeletal ribs of forgotten aircraft baking in the desert sun to the crumbling, silent halls of abandoned architecture, these relics represent not the end of a story, but a pivot point—the moment human utility ceases and the slow, inexorable process of nature’s reclamation begins. This photo essay, titled Discarded, is a visual taxonomy of abandonment, chronicling the entropy of man-made forms across the Arizona landscape.

Captured in the profound visual language of black and white, this collection strips away the distractions of color and context, focusing instead on texture, decay, and the geometry of neglect. The monochrome lens transforms corrosion into contrast, rust into shadow, and peeling paint into intricate, fragile layers of history. By emphasizing the sculptural quality of dilapidation and the silence of vacated spaces, Discarded offers a haunting meditation on obsolescence and the ephemerality of human endeavor. It is a study of how form persists long after function has failed, revealing the strange beauty inherent in things forgotten.
