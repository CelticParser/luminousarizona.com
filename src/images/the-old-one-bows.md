> _The Saguaro, giant of the desert,
<br>
Stands sentinel, a watchful eye
<br><br>
For centuries he'd weathered storms,
<br>
Drunk deep the rain from summer skies
<br><br>
But time, the sculptor, knows no rest,
<br>
And slowly, surely, life departs
<br><br>
The verdant skin, once a vibrant green,
<br>
Now hangs in tatters, worn and torn
<br><br>
The ribs, once hidden, now exposed,
<br>
A skeletal dance beneath the sun
<br><br>
A silent homage to the earth,
<br>
From which all life, its journey's begun
<br><br>
The Old One bows, a graceful arc,
<br>
Returning dust unto the ground
<br><br>
A cycle endless, ever turning,
<br>
Life giving way..._
