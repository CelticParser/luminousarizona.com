<i><b>"The arid canyons and mesas of the Southwest hold monuments not to nature, but to memory."</i></b>

Here, etched into sandstone cliffs and nestled beneath soaring overhangs, lie the enduring homes of the Ancestral Puebloans—architectural testaments to a complex civilization that thrived, then vanished. This photo essay, titled Ancestral Puebloans, is a visual meditation on these abandoned structures, exploring the profound quietude of the rooms, kivas, and walls they left behind, and the cultural remnants found within.

Rendered in high-contrast black and white, this collection moves beyond simple documentation to capture the spiritual gravity of these sites. The monochrome aesthetic emphasizes the texture of ancient mortar, the geometric shadow play across masonry, and the delicate but enduring presence of artifacts: shards of pottery, ground corn, and the ghost-like imprints of hands on plaster. By stripping away the distraction of color, the lens focuses on the structural and spiritual integrity of what remains, allowing the viewer to confront the mystery of departure. Ancestral Puebloans seeks to honor the legacy of those who built and walked these floors, transforming archeological remains into a powerful, tangible echo of human history.
