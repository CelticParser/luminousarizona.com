> _Two sentinels, by sun-baked earth they stood,
<br>Tall saguaros, reaching for the sky
<br><br>
Decades passed, a silent brotherhood,
<br>As seasons wheeled and ancient moments fly
<br><br>
They watched the desert lake, a shimmering grace,
<br>Reflecting clouds and mountains, stark and grand
<br><br>
Their roots entwined, within that arid place,
<br>A testament to friendship, close at hand
<br><br>
Through scorching days and nights of cool embrace,
<br>They shared the whispers of the desert breeze
<br><br>
A steadfast bond, time could not erase,
<br>Rooted deep, beneath the ancient trees
<br><br>
So side by side, they stood, with hearts so true,
<br>Friends of the desert, with a boundless view._
