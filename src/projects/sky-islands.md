<b><i>"The Sky Islands of Southern Arizona are among the most ecologically significant mountain ranges in North America."</i></b>

These towering, isolated peaks, surrounded by vast, arid desert—or "sea"—function as biological refuges, creating distinct, cooler ecosystems at altitude that contrast sharply with the Sonoran floor below. This dramatic vertical geography has resulted in astonishing biodiversity, isolating species over time and fostering unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. This photo essay, titled Sky Islands, is a visual exploration of these majestic and vital landforms, documenting the profound ecological separation that defines them.

Captured in the stark simplicity of black and white, this collection emphasizes the formidable scale of these formations and the dramatic difference between the desert basin and the mountain crest. The monochrome lens is utilized to highlight the textures of geological isolation: the dense, shadow-casting forests of the upper reaches against the sun-blasted granite of the lower slopes. By focusing on contrast, boundary, and height, Sky Islands offers a contemplative journey through these unique biospheres, revealing the profound beauty and fragility of life sustained high above the surrounding arid plains.
