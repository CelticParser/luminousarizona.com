Bells rang here for the first time at the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, when Bishop Henry Granjon, after hearing about the surrender of Germany, ran to the church as it is still under construction, climbed the steps of the tower, and rang the bells to announce Armistice Day to the city of Tucson. The church, whose name means "Holy Cross", was dedicated just a few months later in February 1919.
