> _Does sorrow weave a wreath of prickly shame,
<br>To crown the brow of faith with thorny sting?
<br><br>
Or is it but a cruel and mocking game,
<br>This heavy circlet that the ages bring?
<br><br>
A reel of wire, upon the fence it lies,
<br>A jagged scar across the sun-scorched earth,
<br>Where wild things wander, caught by sharp surprise,
<br>And freedom finds a grim and bitter dearth
<br><br>
The gentle deer, the rabbit in its plight,
<br>Entangled limbs, a struggle to be free,
<br>While rusty barbs reflect the fading light,
<br>A testament to man’s harsh cruelty
<br><br>
So question sorrow, for its shadowed art,
<br>If this barbed wreath truly breaks the heart._
