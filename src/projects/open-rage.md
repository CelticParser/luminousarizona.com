<b><i>"The expansive, unbroken horizon of the Arizona desert, often viewed as a void between population centers, is, in reality, a vast canvas of ecological and historical activity: the open range."</i></b>

These sweeping tracts of land, carved by geology and defined by resilient flora, serve as the foundational setting for the American West, symbolizing both immense freedom and harsh necessity. This essay, titled Open Range, explores a focused photographic series that captures these territorial domains, contrasting the fleeting human presence—a fence, a water trough, a trail—against the backdrop of the land’s enduring, monumental silence.

Captured exclusively in black and white, this collection strips away the distracting colors of tourism and development to focus on the essential truths of the landscape: its texture, its scale, and the profound interplay of light and shadow on the rugged terrain. The monochrome lens transforms the desert, highlighting the raw, infinite geometry of the horizon and the timeless weight of the earth. Open Range posits that the stark visual medium elevates these landscapes from mere geographical locations to enduring symbols of solitude, adaptation, and immensity. By documenting both the subtle evidence of human interaction and the overwhelming power of the land’s natural state, this study communicates a meditation on scale, the cycles of wilderness, and the sacred geography etched across the Sonoran, the Mojave, and the Escalante.
