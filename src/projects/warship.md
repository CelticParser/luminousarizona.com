<b><i>"The arid, sun-bleached expanse of the Arizona desert holds not only the geology of eons but also the enduring, architectural testament to cultural collision: the Spanish colonial missions, churches, and chapels."</i></b>

These structures, rooted in the foundational conquest and evangelism of the 17th and 18th centuries, represent physical monuments to spiritual ambition. This essay, titled Warship, explores a curated photographic series that examines these historical anchors, contrasting the vibrancy of those still operating as houses of worship against the silent decay of those forgotten by time and congregation.

Captured exclusively in black and white, this collection strips away the distracting colors of the modern landscape to focus on the essential qualities of these buildings: their texture, their scale, and the profound interplay of light and shadow on their adobe and stone façades. The monochrome lens transforms the structures, highlighting the raw geometry of their construction and the weight of their history. Warship posits that the stark visual medium elevates these religious sites from mere historical markers to enduring symbols of faith, resilience, and abandonment. By documenting both the active spiritual life continuing within these walls and the slow, inevitable return of the neglected structures to the earth, this study communicates a meditation on the cycles of belief, the enduring power of architecture, and the sacred geography etched across the Sonoran desert.
