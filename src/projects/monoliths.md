<b><i>"Arizona’s identity is forged not just by its vast arid plains, but by the sudden, dramatic ascent of its mountain ranges and isolated peaks."</i></b>

These geological features—the buttes, mesas, and sky islands—stand as silent, immovable sentinels, defying the forces of erosion and time. This photo essay, titled Monoliths, is a visual dedication to these prominent peaks found across the state, from the iconic red walls of Sedona to the volcanic spires of the San Francisco Peaks, capturing their sheer scale and profound isolation.

Captured exclusively in the severe simplicity of black and white, this collection strips away distracting color to emphasize the raw architectural truth of the mountains. The monochrome lens transforms granite, basalt, and sandstone into pure texture and form, highlighting the deep, chiseled lines of ancient strata and the dramatic geometry created by sunlight and shadow. By focusing on contrast and scale, Monoliths aims to articulate the spiritual weight and physical grandeur of these isolated giants. It is a photographic meditation on permanence, revealing the deep geologic narrative written into the stone and the enduring power of earth's most formidable structures.
