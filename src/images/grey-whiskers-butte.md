> _Upon red lands where ancient mesas stand,
A spirit walked, a guide named Grey Whiskers,
Whose heart was tied to this ancestral land,
He watched the sun on desert rock, it flickers
<br><br>He saw the beauty and the solemn grace,
The towering buttes, the arches in the sky,
And knew his people's history and place,
Should live beyond when he himself should die
<br><br>He spoke of sacred ground, of timeless art,
Of canyons carved by wind and patient rain,
And helped to give this vision a new start,
To save this land from thoughtless, worldly gain
<br><br>His legacy, a park, a people's pride,
Where shadows of his spirit still reside._
