> _A monolith, twin hands clasped in prayer
<br>Beneath the Hunter's Moon, a silent plea
<br>
<br>For him who hunts, through darkness, cold, and snare
<br>May fortune favor, and his spirit be free
<br><br>
The moon, a watchful eye, illuminates
<br>The ancient stone, a sentinel of night
<br><br>
A silent guardian, it elevates
<br>The hunter's spirit, guiding him aright
<br>Through deserts' dark and fields of rocky ground
<br><br>
He follows trails, his heart both filled with fear
<br>And hope, as ancient echoes resound
<br><br>
Within the silent clifs, year after year
<br>And so, the hunter, guided by the moon
<br>And blessed by hands of stone, pursues his boon._
