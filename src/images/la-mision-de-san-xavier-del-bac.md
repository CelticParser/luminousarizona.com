> _Across the field, where white cotton grows,
A hazy line defines the verdant plain,
And there, a vision from the earth upsprings,
Where Tucson's light its storied beauty throws.
<br><br>
From heavy cumulus, a glory flows,
As God-rays pierce the sky, like silver rain,
And on the desert's canvas, stark and clean,
The White Dove of the Desert softly glows.
<br><br>
The carved façade, a pearly, holy sight,
It draws the gaze beyond the tilled expanse,
A silent promise in the waning light,
A sanctuary holding time's slow dance.
<br><br>
​It stands afar, a relic stark and grand,
As when the last of them released its hand.
