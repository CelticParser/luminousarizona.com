<b><i>"The Saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) stands as the silent, colossal sentinel of the Sonoran Desert, a living monument to centuries of arid persistence."</i></b>

...Yet, this icon of the American Southwest faces a slow, escalating crisis that threatens its majestic presence. This essay, titled Muerte de un Saguaro, documents the quiet demise of these desert giants, focusing on the dual forces of natural attrition and the devastating encroachment of the invasive African buffelgrass. The grass, a dry, highly flammable fuel source, transforms the Saguaro's native, fire-resistant ecosystem into a recurrent inferno, sentencing mature and young cacti alike to certain destruction.

Captured in the profound visual language of black and white, this photographic collection strips away the vibrant, distracting greens and blues to emphasize the structural tragedy of the Saguaro's decay. The monochrome lens highlights the skeletal remains of fire-damaged giants, the scarred ribs of those weakened by age or drought, and the stark contrast between the towering, vulnerable flesh and the low, aggressive invader. Muerte de un Saguaro is a somber eulogy expressed through light and shadow, serving as a critical examination of an ecological battle fought in slow motion across the Arizona landscape. It is a visual plea to witness the fragility of an enduring symbol before its legacy is reduced to ash.
