The Spanish dream, by gilded hope defined,
<br>
Sought golden spires in Arizona's heat,
<br>
They came for wealth, with avarice in mind,
<br>
And drove their quest where painted canyons meet
<br><br>
They crossed the sands where wind had swept the track,
<br>
Through barren flats where nothing soft could grow,
<br>
And found no stone with shining metal's back,
<br>
No river banked with silver's steady glow
<br><br>
They saw no gold, no jewels, no hidden seam,
<br>
But colors deep in clay and petrified wood,
<br>
The land itself, a geological dream,
<br>
A truth more stark than they had understood
<br><br>
The treasure lay in ochre, gray, and red,
<br>
El Desierto Pintado —- thus they seen.
