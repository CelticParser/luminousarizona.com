<b><i>"Aside The Great Western Trail - What have I gained by the toil of the trail?"</i></b>

I know and know well.
<br><br>
I have found once again the lore I had lost
<br>
In the loud city's hell.
<br><br>
I have broadened my hand to the cinch and the axe,
<br>
I have laid my flesh to the rain;
<br>
I was hunter and trailer and guide;
<br>
I have touched the most primitive wildness again.
<br><br>
I have threaded the wild with the stealth of the deer,
<br>
No eagle is freer than I;
<br>
No mountain can thwart me, no torrent appall,
<br>
I defy the stern sky.
<br><br>
So long as I live these joys will remain,
<br>
I have touched the most primitive wildness again.
<br><br>
Hamlin Garland. 1893
