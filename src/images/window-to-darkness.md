> _A chance appears, a window to the light,
<br>
Or so it seems, a promise in the frame
<br><br>
But memory recalls the endless night,
<br>
Each opened door, a shadow and a shame
<br><br>
I’ve walked these halls, believed in gilded lies,
<br>
And stepped through arches into deeper dread,
<br>
The hopeful phrase that dances in their eyes,
<br>
Has only ever led to what I've fled
<br><br>
So let this portal beckon, gleam, and call,
<br>
I know its promise rings a hollow sound
<br><br>
To step within is only but to fall,
<br>
And on the other side, no peace is found
<br><br>
My future's not to choose which path to take,
<br>
But tear my walls down for my own soul's sake._
