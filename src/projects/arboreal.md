<i><b>"Arizona, the state of extremes, hosts an astonishing biodiversity defined by elevation, where arid desert floors ascend rapidly into alpine peaks."</b></i>

This vertical landscape supports an intricate tapestry of flora, from the tenacious, scrubby survivors of the Sonoran lowlands to the dense, venerable coniferous forests of the high mountains. This photo essay, titled Arboreal, is a visual exploration of this immense botanical range, charting the evolutionary journey of trees and plant life across the state's dramatic climate zones.

Captured in the stark medium of black and white, this collection strips away the green hue of the forest to focus instead on the essential forms, textures, and adaptations of the flora. The monochrome lens highlights the gnarled resilience of a desert mesquite, the flaking bark of a high-country ponderosa pine, and the delicate, wind-sculpted branches of an aspen grove. By emphasizing light, shadow, and structure, the photographic study reveals the hidden, rigorous architecture inherent in these forms. Arboreal is a meditation on the power of adaptation and the silent, slow-motion drama of botanical survival, offering a compelling visual narrative of Arizona's ecological layers, from sand to summit.
