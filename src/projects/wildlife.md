<b><i>"Arizona’s reputation as an arid expanse often overshadows the astonishing diversity of life that moves within its borders."</i></b>

From the vast, open ranges to the isolated ecological pockets of the Sky Islands, the state is a crucible of adaptation, sustaining creatures that are both remnants of a storied past and unique products of evolutionary isolation. This photo essay, titled Wildlife, is a dedicated exploration of this living heritage, documenting the spectrum of native and historically significant species—from the elusive Gila monster to the herds of indigenous Mustangs, enduring symbols left behind by the Spanish entrada centuries ago.

Captured in the rigorous simplicity of black and white, this collection emphasizes form, motion, and the essential texture of survival. The monochrome lens removes the camouflage of color, compelling the viewer to focus on the expressive lines of an animal's coat, the intensity of its gaze, and the profound contrasts between fragile life and the immense, harsh environment. Wildlife serves as a powerful visual testament to the resilience and spectacular variety of Arizona’s creatures, advocating for a deeper appreciation of the complex, often hidden, living tapestry of the desert and its surrounding mountains.
